If you want to build a project quick and easy in TypeScript, this project's for
you. Comes configured with `prettier`, `eslint`, and `jest`.

Targets Node 12.

`prettier-eslint` is locked at 9.0.1, since newer versions don't seem to work
with `coc-prettier`'s `prettier-eslint` integration and I can't figure out why.
